# Background  
I created this HTML resume to establish my online presence as I transition into data analytics. Having a personal website allows me to showcase my technical skills, projects, and experience in a way that is easily accessible to potential employers and recruiters. Additionally, this project helps me strengthen my understanding of HTML and version control using GitHub.  

# Tools Used  
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.  
- **VS Code**: As the code editor for writing and debugging HTML.  
- **Live preview**: For real-time preview of the webpage.  
- **GitHub**: For version control and hosting the online resume.  
- **GitHub Pages**: To publish the website and make it accessible online.  

# What I Learned  
Thanks to Angela Yu from Udemy for providing valuable insights into how HTML works. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of structuring web pages using HTML and the importance of version control with GitHub.  

One key takeaway was realizing that when connecting GitHub to VS Code, it must be set up under the **workspace**. If not, the **Live Preview** feature may not work properly. Ensuring the correct setup allows for seamless development and real-time updates while working on web projects.  


# Conclusion  
Building this HTML resume was a valuable learning experience that helped me understand the fundamentals of web development. Through this project, I gained hands-on practice with structuring content using HTML and managing version control with GitHub.  

This project also reinforced the importance of setting up a proper development environment, including correctly linking GitHub with VS Code to ensure features like Live Preview work smoothly.  

Overall, creating my online resume not only helped me showcase my professional background but also provided a strong foundation for future web development and portfolio-building projects.
